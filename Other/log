Overkillintegrity log



Version 1.0.0   Slow for large files. Might build bigger version: n-MB segments,
                which will require  distribution[][]  of type char for saving on
                space, and limiting number of copies to 256  (currently no lim.)
                Updated "how to" & moved to bottom.  Used file name loading from
                my Overkillographic.cpp and discovered  mishandling of file name
                length.  Fixed it here and there.  See Overkillographic log. The
                "Byte differences" counter has been tested  by modifying  files,
                creating files with C++, as well as modifying same Byte indexes.
